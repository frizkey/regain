# Enhance Feature

v0.3
----
()

* Make Lucene Value "filelocation" relative to thumnailFolder
* Changed Lucene Value "no thumbnailer found" to "nothumbnailerfound" (to avoid tokenizing)
* Add <thumbnailer:img/> to taglib

v0.2
----
(2. August 2011)

+ MIME-Test: Office2007-Files & OpenOffice files are detected via Zip/XML
# Upgrade PDFBox 1.5.0 -> 1.6.0
* JODConverter didn't delete his temporary files if conversion failed

Failing tests:
- ChainedHashtable: testBacking              (not important, as currently not used)
- MimeDetectionTest: testOfficeFiles{1,2,3}  (meaning only that conversion takes longer than necessary) 
- ThumbnailersFailingTest: testFailingJOD    (JOD may falsely claim having succeeded when converting a binary file)
