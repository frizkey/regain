* It is now possible to use any Lucene analyzer.

  version 1.2.1.


Version 1.2 on 2007-07-20
-------------------------

* The search result show now icons indicating the file's type.
* The index fields "size" and "last-modified" are now searchable.
* New preparator: EmptyPreparator (Contributed by Gerhard Olsson). This
  preparator extracts no content files assigned to it. Therefore only the path
  and the filename is written to the index (helpful for all file types having no
  matching preparator).
* The maximum number of terms per document is now configurable using the
  <maxFieldLength> tag in the CrawlerConfiguration.xml. Default is 10000.
* The IfilterPreparator works now under Windows Server 2003, too.
* The values for the <search:input_fieldlist> tag may now be determined when
  indexing. Therefore this operation beeing slow for large indexes must not be
  executed any more when searching the first time. This may be configured
  using the <valuePrefetchFields> tag in the CrawlerConfiguration.xml.
* Several bugfixes


Version 1.1.1 on 2006-03-27
---------------------------

* Bugfixes in the server variant


Version 1.1 on 2006-02-26
-------------------------

* regain now searches the URLs, too.
* The desktop search now shows the last log messages.
* Better handling of HTTP-Redirects. (Thanks to Gerhard Olsson)
* Auxiliary fields have new options: "tokenize", "store" and "index".
* Added documentation of the Tag Library.
* The search mask now accepts multiple "query" parameters
  (they are just concatinated)
* The Jacob preparators have been improved. (Thanks to Reinhard Balling)
* New preparator ExternalPrepartor: This preparator calls an external program
  or script in order to get the text of documents. (Thanks to Paul Ortyl)
* Completed italian localization. (Thanks to Franco Lombardo)
* Some Bugfixes


Version 1.1 Beta 6 on 2005-12-05
--------------------------------

* New preparator: With the PoiMsPowerPointPreparator there is now a platform
  independant preparator for Powerpoint. (Thanks to Gerhard Olsson)
* New preparator: The IfilterPreparator uses the I-Filter interface of
  Microsoft to read various file formats. Unfortunately it only works on Windows.
* Multi index search: In the SearchConfiguration.xml now several indexes may be
  specified as default.
* The auxiliary fields have now a better handling for case sensitivity.
* The HTTP agent sent by the crawler to the web servers may now be configured in
  the CrawlerConfiguration.xml. This way the crawler can identify itself as
  Internet Explorer, for example.
* Several bugfixes


Version 1.1 Beta 5 on 2005-08-13
--------------------------------

* Multi index search: It is now possible to search several search indexes over
  one search mask. The search query is executed on every index and is merged
  afterwards.
* The white and the black list now allow regular expressions, too.
* Search mask: The location of ressources and the configuration is better
  detected now. Therefor regain works properly now, even if Tomcat is running
  as service.
* Search mask: The file-to-http-bridge is may be switched off now.
* Crawler: The crawler needs less memory now when crawling directories.
* Crawler: The crawler now adds failed documents as well to the index. Therefore
  they are not retried the next time the crawler is running. But if the crawler
  is executed with the option "-retryFailedDocs", all failed documents are
  retried.
* The HTML preparator now preparates the extensions .jsp, .php, .php3, .php4
  and .asp as well.
* It's now possible to specify in the CrawlerConfiguration.xml which documents
  should be preparated with a certain preparator.
* Several bugfixes


Version 1.1 Beta 4 on 2005-04-13
--------------------------------

* Access rights management: It is now possible to integrate an access rights
  management, that ensures that a user only sees results for documents he has
  reading rights for.
* Search: The search taglib has now a tag "hit_field", that writes an index
  field value. The tag "hit_summary" was thereby removed.
* Search: If you don't want to read the search config from an XML file or if
  you don't want to write the location of the XML file in the web.xml, you
  may write your own SearchConfigFactory class and create the config on your
  own. The SearchConfigFactory class is specified in the web.xml.
* Server search: The enclosed JSP pages did not work.


Version 1.1 Beta 3 on 2005-03-17
--------------------------------

* Crawler: Bugfix: The PoiMsExcelPreparator did not get on with all number and
  date formats.
* Crawler: The error log is now more detailed (with stacktraces).
* Crawler: Preparators are now encapsulated in own jars. Thus the regain.jar
  only contains what regain itself needs and preparators may be replaced more
  easily. Also other developers may provide preparators that can be mounted
  very easily.
  The configuration of the preparators is still in the CrawlerConfiguration.xml.
  But now not all preparators must be declared. The preparators are executed in
  the same order as they are configured, the unconfigured preparators afterwards.
* Desktop search: The desktop search now runs under Linux, too.
* Search: Bugfix: Files whichs URL contains a double slash (e.g. of network
  drives: //fileserver/bla/blubb) couldn't be loaded.
* Desktop search: Bugfix: At the search results umlauts were presentet wrong.
* Desktop search: On the status page a currently running index update can now be
  paused and an index update can be started.
* Crawler: Bugfix: The HtmlPraeparator did not get on with all files.


Version 1.1 Beta 2 on 2005-03-12
--------------------------------

* Crawler: The crawler now creates periodically so called breakpoint. When doing
  so the current state of the search index is copied into a separate directory.
  If the index update should be cancelled (e.g. if the computer is shut down),
  the crawler will go on from the last breakpoint.
* Desktop search: The status page now shows the timing results.


Version 1.1 Beta 1 on 2005-03-10
--------------------------------

* Desktop search: reagain now provides a desktop search besides the server
  search. The desktop searchs provides many features that makes the use as easy
  as winking:
    - An installer for Windows.
    - Integration in the task bar under Linux and Windows.
    - Configuration over the browser.
    - Status monitoring over the browser.
* Crawler: There is now a preparator for OpenOffice and StarOffice documents.
* All: Updated to the newest versions of the used projects.
* Crawler: Preparators are now configurable by the CrawlerConfiguration.xml.
* Search: The Search is now configured by the SearchConfiguration.xml, not the
  web.xml any more. There is only the path to the SearchConfiguration.xml
  any more.
* Search: The Search now provides URL rewriting. This way you can index
  documents in file://c:/www‚Äëdata/intranet/docs and show the documents in the
  browser as http://intranet.murfman.de/docs.
* Crawler: Auxiliary fields: The index may now be extended by auxiliary fields
  that are extracted from a document's URL.
  Example: Assumed you have a directory with a sub directory for every project.
  Then you can generate an auxiliary field with the project name. Doing so you
  get only documents from that directory when searching for
  "Offer¬†project:otto23".
* Search: Advanced search: All values that are in the index for one field may
  now be provided as a combo box on the search page. Particularly together with
  auxiliary fields this is very useful.
* Search: Some browsers load for security reasons no file links from http pages.
  Thus all documents that are in the index are now provided over HTTP. Of corse
  at the desktop search these documents are only accessible from the local host.
* Crawler: The JacobMsWordPreparator now regards styles. Thus it is possible
  to extract headlines that will be weight more when searching.
* Crawler: The JacobMsOfficePreparators are now able to extract the description
  fields (Title, author, etc.)


Version 1.0 on 2004-06-10
-------------------------

* First version
